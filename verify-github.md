# 🔍 GitHub Repository Verification Guide

## **Step 1: Check the Correct URL**
Make sure you're visiting: https://github.com/DigitalExpart/-The-New-Alkebulan

## **Step 2: Check the Branch**
- Look for the branch dropdown (should show "main")
- Click on it and make sure "main" is selected

## **Step 3: Force Refresh**
- Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- This bypasses browser cache

## **Step 4: What You Should See**
Your repository should contain:

### **Root Level Files:**
- ✅ `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `next.config.mjs`
- ✅ `vercel.json`
- ✅ `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ `tailwind.config.ts`

### **Folders:**
- ✅ `app/` (Next.js pages)
- ✅ `components/` (React components)
- ✅ `data/` (data files)
- ✅ `hooks/` (custom hooks)
- ✅ `lib/` (utilities)
- ✅ `types/` (TypeScript types)
- ✅ `utils/` (utility functions)
- ✅ `scripts/` (database scripts)

## **Step 5: If Files Are Missing**
1. **Check the commit history** - click on "commits" to see recent changes
2. **Look for the latest commit**: "Fix Vercel deployment: Simplify homepage and fix build issues"
3. **Click on that commit** to see what files were changed

## **Step 6: Alternative View**
- Click on the **"Code"** tab
- You should see all the folders and files listed

## **Still Having Issues?**
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache completely
- Check if you're logged into the correct GitHub account
